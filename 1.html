  <h2>Speech 소개</h2>
  <p>My name is <strong>Kim Namjoon</strong>, also known as RM, the leader of the group BTS.
  It is an incredible honor to be invited to an occasion with such significance for today's young generation.</p>
  <p>Last November, BTS launched the Love Myself campaign with UNICEF built on our belief that true love first begins with loving myself. We've been partnering with UNICEF's End Violence program to protect children and young people all over the world from violence. And our fans have become a major part of this campaign with their action and with their enthusiasm. We truly have the best fans in the world.</P>
